# TNC Toolbox: Web Performance

**WP.org:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/tnc-toolbox

- Allows you to purge the EA-NGINX User Cache from within WP
- Automatically purges the cache when a post or page is updated
- Does the same when the WP Core has been successfully upgraded :)
- Allows you to disable or enable the NGINX User Cache from inside WP
- Only presents the options to enable/disable/configure for WP Admins
- For any action, redirects you back to the page you requested it from

> **Will expand to include other features as requested by community & clients!**

## üñ•Ô∏è (PLUGIN) System Requirements

- cPanel API Key, cPanel Username & Server Hostname needed in Settings
- Hosting Environment must be cPanel+WHM, running NGINX + Apache stack!

> Note: EA-NGINX (Reverse Proxy) by cPanel is supported, not "old school" implementations.
> 
> CloudLinux Apache2NGINX (A2N) depends on ea-NGINX so shouldn't cause issues with TNC Toolbox.
